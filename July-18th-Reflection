This is my first class at Brown Pre-College for the Artificial Intelligence: A Computational Account of Intelligence course. I first met Mr. Quartey, a current Brown PhD student here at Brown. First on the agenda was a course overview, specifically covering the topics of the course and the expectations of the course. We then delved into our prior understanding and definitions of AI, such as analyzing the ways an AI can differ into specific and general intelligence. We concluded the class with a set-up of our computers, including Visual Studio, Miniconda, and our GitHub accounts.
